# The Game

A 2D top-down pixel art game built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. Features player movement, NPCs, minigames, a shop system, and an inventory.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Starting the Game

**Option 1: Using the Start Script (Recommended)**

```bash
./scripts/start-server.sh
```

This will automatically:

- Find an available HTTP server (Python, Node.js, or http-server)
- Start the server on port 8080
- Open your browser to the game

**Option 2: Direct File**
Simply open `game.html` in your browser (some features may not work).

**Option 3: Node.js Server**

```bash
node server.js
```

**Option 4: Python Server**

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

**Option 5: Live Server**
If you have VS Code/Cursor with Live Server extension:

1. Open the workspace file: `the-game.code-workspace`
2. Right-click on `game.html` → "Open with Live Server"

### Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move player
- **Shift**: Sprint (drains stamina)
- **E**: Open/close inventory
- **Q**: Interact (NPCs, red X tiles for minigames)
- **1-5**: Buy items in shop (when shop is open)
- **SPACE**: Used in brushing minigame

### Gameplay Tips

1. Find red X tiles on the ground and press Q to start a minigame
2. Complete minigames to earn money
3. Visit the shopkeeper (yellow sprite) to buy better shovels
4. Better shovels = better rewards from minigames
5. Talk to NPCs by getting close and pressing Q

## 🎯 Features

### Core Mechanics

- **Player Movement**: Move with WASD or Arrow Keys, sprint with Shift
- **Stamina System**: Sprint drains stamina, regenerates when not sprinting
- **Procedural World**: 2400x2000 pixel world with procedurally generated tiles
- **Camera System**: Smooth camera follow with pixel-perfect rendering

### NPCs & Interactions

- **Shopkeeper**: Buy shovels and equipment at the shop
- **Old Guy**: Friendly NPC who greets you
- **Dialogue System**: Press Q to interact with NPCs and progress dialogue

### Minigames

- **Balancing Minigame** (50% chance): Balance a pot on a stick for 15 seconds using arrow keys
- **Brushing Minigame** (50% chance): Hold SPACE to brush dirt clean, release before it turns red (5-10 seconds)

### Shop & Inventory

- **Shop System**: Purchase shovels of different tiers (Tier 1-5)
- **Inventory**: Press E to open/close inventory
- **Equipment**: Equipped shovels affect minigame rewards

### Money System

- Earn money by completing minigames
- Money displayed in top-right corner with decorative border
- Shovel multipliers increase rewards:
  - Tier 1: 1.5x (success: 4.5x)
  - Tier 2: 2.0x (success: 6.0x)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Rendering**: Canvas 2D API with pixelated rendering
- **Camera**: Smooth follow with lerp (0.12), rounded to prevent jitter
- **Collision**: Circle-based collision detection
- **Performance**: 60fps using requestAnimationFrame
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Git Configuration

This project uses **Git Bash** as the default terminal (configured in `.vscode/settings.json`).

### GitHub CLI Setup (No Admin Required)

If you don't have admin rights, you can install GitHub CLI locally:

```bash
# Create local bin directory
mkdir -p ~/bin

# Download and extract GitHub CLI
cd ~/bin
curl -L -o gh.zip https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/latest/download/gh_2.83.2_windows_amd64.zip
unzip -q gh.zip && rm gh.zip

# Add to PATH for current session
export PATH="$HOME/bin/bin:$PATH"

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login
```

**Note:** Add `export PATH="$HOME/bin/bin:$PATH"` to your `~/.bashrc` to make it permanent.

### Git Credential Helper

Configure Git to use GitHub CLI for authentication:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper ""
git config --global credential.helper "!gh auth git-credential"
```

### Fork Syncing

This project has two remotes:

- `origin` - Main repository (nyrobovines-bit/the-game)
- `fork` - Fork repository (runningsammy/the-game)

**To push changes:**

1. **Push to origin (direct push):**

   ```bash
   git push origin fork-main:main
   ```

2. **Sync to fork (if direct push fails):**
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/bin/bin:$PATH"  # If using local gh installation
   gh repo sync runningsammy/the-game --force
   ```

The fork is configured to sync from upstream, so use `gh repo sync` instead of direct `git push` to the fork remote.
